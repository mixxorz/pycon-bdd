# PyCon PH BDD Lightning Talk

This is the code I used to demo BDD with Python and Django.

# Usage

First you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I created branches for different levels of completion for the project. You can
access these via the checkouting out these branches. For example, 
`$ git checkout step0` would bring you to the initial state, with nothing
working but the assets.

Run the behave tests by issuing the `python manage.py behave` command.

Have fun!
